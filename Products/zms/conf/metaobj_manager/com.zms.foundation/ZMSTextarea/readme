# ZMSTextarea
ZMSTextarea is the standard element for text blocks. It offers two kind of input fields:

1. plain text
2. rich-text (wysiswyg)

The ZMSTextarea-GUI is customzied by text-format definitions for:

1. paragraphs (block formats like h1, h2, p)
2. characters (inline formats like bold, italic)

A paragraph format is declared for the whole text block, whereas character formats can nest any text string inline.
Both plain text and richt-text editors provide a list of the configured block formats. But inly the plan text editor 
can be customizd by the configured character formats, because the rich-text editor frontends integrate a set of inline 
format by themselves.
For the plain text editor a helper funcion for valifdating the html/XML wellformedness by setting a configuration parameter:
`ZMS.ZMSTextarea.show_htmlcheck`: 1

## Rich Text / WYSIWYG Exitors

By default ZMS comes with three types of richt text editors (RTE)

1. CKEditor (HTML)
2. TinyMCE (HTML)
3. SimpleMDE (Markdown)

The list of RTE can be extendes by adding a TAL-based template `manage_form` as a plugins to the plugin-rte-folder:
`Products/zms/plugins/rte/`.  
The editor's JS/GUI-asset files can be placed in the as `++resource++zms_` registred resource folder
`Products/zms/plugins/www`
To tell the ZMS client which one of the RTEs should be applied, a configuration parameter has to be set:
`ZMS.richtext.plugin` (ckeditor, tinymce, simplemde etc.)

## Using Markdown
The SimpleMDE-editor is a minimal markdown editor using the Python module *markdown*. This module will be installed 
by default (if code base is fresh), see on [github](https://github.com/zms-publishing/ZMS/blob/main/requirements-full.txt).

After setting ZMS configuration parameter 
`ZMS.richtext.plugin`: `simplemde`
at least a paragraph format named `markdown` is needed. ZMS provides a suitable set of paragraph formats named 
`markdown-0.0.1` for one-click-import: it contains the markdown format as the standard format and a typical set 
of several html block elements.
