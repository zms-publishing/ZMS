# Managing ZMS-Content-Index with Opensearch
ZMS offers an [Opensearch](https://opensearch.org/) connector for the crucial tasks of index management. 
Before letting Opensearch create an index, Opensearch needs to know how to index the content. Therefore Opensearch needs to get the content "schema" (as a JSON-based list of typed fields). By listing  

1. all ZMS content types and
2. the attributes of these types

the _ZMS Catalog Adapter GUI_ helps creating that schema: any content types (usually _pages_) and attributes can be selected for this purpose. Usually the _standard_html_-attribute provides the full text wheras other attributes can be added specifically like _title_, _titlealt_, _description_. Their content may be applied when search results are listed. 

ZMS will send to the index only the content of the by _ZMS Catalog Adapter_ selected contenttypes and its selected attributes. So before starting, please makre sure that the selections in the _ZMS Catalog Adapter GUI_  is correct. 
Then the first step to prepare Opensearch is _Create Schema_: based on the  _ZMS Catalog Adapter_ selections ZMS will save a small JSON file as a configuration parameter. The second step is _Initialisation_, which leads to an empty index based on that content schema. After this is done the content can be primarily indexed with "Refresh".

_Menu items for managing the index:_

1. **Create Schema**: Generating the field schema of the index in JSON format
2. **Initialisation**: Creating an index on the Opensearch server
3. **Refresh**: Re-/Indexing the ZMS client as a whole
4. **Deleting**: Removing the index on the Opensearch server

---

After the initial indexing the content will be index incrementally on any content change.

_Important hint_: The action "Initialisation" creates/recreates always an **empty** index based on the selected attribute schema. So if a schema is changed and the index initialised, all indexed items are gone and a new full reindexing will be necessary.
