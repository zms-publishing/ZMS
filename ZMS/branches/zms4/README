ZMS: Simplified Content Modelling
=================================

ZMS is the Python-based Content Management and E-Publishing System for Science, Technology and Medicine. A simple editing interface and flexible content model (multilingualism, metadata, content objects, XML import/export, workflow etc.) is designed for optimal productivity for web sites, documentation and educational content. 

Modularity of the ZMS components and approved production processes turn ZMS into an incomparably rapid tool. The underlying efficiency-oriented publication model is the result of many consulting projects in recent years by HOFFMANN+LIEBENBERG in association with SNTL Publishing, Berlin.

Prerequisites
-------------

    |   ``virtualenv`` is the PyPA recommended tool for creating isolated Python environments:
    |   https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html

    |   ``pip`` is the PyPA recommended tool for installing and managing Python packages:
    |   https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html

	Users of Microsoft Windows 10 can enable the Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL) for installing ZMS as under Linux (`Bash on Ubuntu on Windows <https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/commandline/wsl/install_guide>`_). Users of former Windows version have to install a development environment. MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows, http://www.mingw.org) provides a complete Open Source programming tool set which is suitable (`more hints <http://www.zms-publishing.com/download/installation_windows/index_ger.html>`_).
    
	Apple OS X running updated Xcode command line tools causes compiler errors rather than warnings used until before. You can `downgrade these errors to warnings <https://langui.sh/2014/03/10/wunused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future-is-a-harsh-mistress/>`_ again.

    If you get compilation errors like ``fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory compilation terminated``, install development headers using your system's recommended package manager.
